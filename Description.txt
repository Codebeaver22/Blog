package CloudLet {
    class "Cloud Management Platform" {
        Policy Based Scheduling
    }
    class "SDI Platform Small" {
        VMWare
        OpenStack

    "Cloud Management Platform" -> "SDI Platform Small"
}
note right
What is the smallest size of the data for a cloudlet to:
Authenticate all users in the cloud federation
All other data required to run any job or at least start a job remotely.

This should help answer the storage requirements for the Cloudlet.

note right
Where is data impacted:
1. Data Latency?
2. Does data Gravity have a big play
3. What VMs do you want localized
4. What images are required on the Remote Clouds
5. Updates to Cloudlets.
